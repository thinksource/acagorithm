============

This is fast string algorithm base on Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm.[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm)

The code is base on python 3.6, no additional library need.

The running potral is main.py. The main implement is on ACalgorithm.py

The test case can put into Test.py
