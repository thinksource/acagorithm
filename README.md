============

This is fast string algorithm base on Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm.[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm)
which is extends of KMP algorithm and this algorithm also base on finite-state machine.

## How to run
The code is base on python 3.6, no additional library need.

Just run 

```python main.py```

The running potral is main.py. The main implement is on ACalgorithm.py.

The testcase can find at Test.py
